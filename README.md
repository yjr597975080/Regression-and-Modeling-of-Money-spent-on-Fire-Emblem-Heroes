# Regression-and-Modeling-of-Money-spent-on-Fire-Emblem-Heroes
## Introduction:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With technology and mass media taking the forefront of our daily lives, we as consumers
spend more and more time with our personal devices. From reading work emails to trying out the
latest fads, the smartphone has become integral to our daily lives, providing us with a means of
communication as well as a source of entertainment. One such source of entertainment comes
from video games. 10 years ago, one who indulged in video games would be considered a big fan,
but now, the entry bar has dropped significantly, and access to video games has become quite
literally ‘one tap away’ on a device of choice. As with all other forms of entertainment, success as
a creator within a medium is associated with money and profits. In 2016, the video game industry
hit a total revenue of 25.4 Billion dollars in just the United States, and this number only increases
on a year by year basis. Our project looks at the population of people who spend money on video
games, and how the characteristics of players can be used to estimate how much money they
spend on one particular video game. In particular, our main research question is the following:
“What constitutes how gamers spend money on video games?”. To answer this question, we will 
be using data taken from a survey taken by a user on Reddit, which was posed to players of the
mobile game “Fire Emblem: Heroes”.
